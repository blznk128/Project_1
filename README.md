# Project_1

4 developers and my self built a "escape" room type of game for our group project. We thought that making a game would be a lot of fun and come with its own unique challenges. The object is to answer correctly the riddles that we placed, if you got it right, a new page would open, if not, you were stuck. To make it a little more fun is we added a timer as well.

We were happy on what we came up with on such little time. Not only did we get the timer to show up on all pages, we also implemented a firebase to which it saves the users name and their score and displays it at the end of the game.

We all contributed heavily into this project. My portion of it was a good amount of the design such as colors, also building the form for the user name as well as the scoreboard and making the timer show up properly on every page.
